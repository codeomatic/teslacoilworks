    <h1>Demonstrations</h1>
    

    <p>In my demonstrations I want to vividly show the beauty in the spectacular arcs, sparks and corona glow created by
Tesla Coils and other High Voltage apparatus. As part of the demos I add explanations of the science involved in
the operation of the equipment and the discharges. I put the high voltage devices into their place in the History
of Technology, and explain how advances in science allowed the development of devices that could generate ever higher 
voltages (and thus more beauty).</p>
<p>I typically start out my demos with the generation of high voltage Static electricity, and then progress to the 
development of Alternating Current (AC) electricity which allowed the use of transformers to produce high voltages 
(10,000 volts) such as used in the Jacobs Ladder apparatus with ascending arcs. A further development of the 
transformer produced the Induction Coil which can change 12V into 100,000 volts or more. The high voltage Direct 
Current (DC) produced by the Induction Coil (along with the use of vacuum pumps) led to the invention of Radio, 
X-ray tubes, and the discovery of the electron which was the first component of nuclear physics.
Plasma Globes and Plasma Light Sabers are an example of high voltage electrical discharges thru low pressure inert 
gases, and show the specific light spectrum emitted by each type of gas. This is how astronomers determine what types 
of atoms are in stars that are thousands of light years away.</p>
<p>In 1890 Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla Coil which took tens of thousands of volts generated by HV transformers 
and converted it to Radio Frequency energy which could be fed into his new coil, and then transformed into Millions 
of volts of electricity. His dream was to develop wireless power transmission for use by all of humanity, and this 
effort cumulated in his 1898 Tesla Coil in Colorado Springs that created 135 foot long arcs. For my demos I usually 
bring 2 medium Tesla coils, a vacuum tube Tesla Coil with 2 foot arcs and a traditional spark gap type Tesla Coil 
with 3 foot arcs.</p>
<p>A demo of my Tesla Coils and other high voltage equipment can last from about 20 minutes to over 50 minutes 
depending upon how many pieces of equipment I bring, how many experiments are run with each device, and how 
comprehensive my explanations of the science and operation of the apparatus are. I usually develop a semi-customized 
demo plan for each different venue. </p>
<p>I have run this equipment at over a dozen locations with no problems, including GearCon at the Lloyd Center 
Doubletree Hotel, the Red Lion at Jantzen beach, the Marriott Waterfront and the Crown Plaza hotels, at art 
galleries, and the Tillamook County Library. My equipment has been run at the OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry) 
Maker Fair for 5 years, and for three years there we ran my BIG Tesla Coil which has 6 to 7 foot long arcs. 
The Portland Fire Marshal inspected and approved my setups there every year. In February of 2018 I gave eight 
demos at the Portland Winter Light Festival. My setup was in the Oregon Rail Heritage Center, and we had between 
300 and 500 people at every demo. I estimate that over 5000 people have seen my demos with no problems.</p>
