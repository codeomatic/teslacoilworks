    <h1>Introduction</h1>
    

    <p>A wee bit of introduction for me. I am a Physicist and Electrical Engineer, and originally worked at Tektronix 
before moving into Electrical Engineering and specializing in Power Distribution Systems, power supply design for 
electronics, and worked as a Power Quality engineer at PGE. I later moved into EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) 
Engineering and Electrical Product Safety areas. I started making Tesla Coils in high school, and the coils gradually 
became larger, and larger, in an effort to make longer arcs.</p>
<p>About 9 years ago I became interested in the Steampunk community and its design aesthetic. In the Steampunk community 
Tesla has a near god status, so I built a Tesla Coil small enough to be easily moved, developed a presentation on the 
life and inventions of Nikola Tesla, and started giving talks at Steampunk and Science Fiction Conventions on Tesla 
with Tesla Coil demo sessions at the end.  All of my equipment is built with the Steampunk design aesthetic in mind 
and is designed to be displayed, and has been entered in several Steampunk Art shows. </p>
