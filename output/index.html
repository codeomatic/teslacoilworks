    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p><p>A wee bit of introduction for me. I am a Physicist and Electrical Engineer, and originally worked at Tektronix 
before moving into Electrical Engineering and specializing in Power Distribution Systems, power supply design for 
electronics, and worked as a Power Quality engineer at PGE. I later moved into EMC (Electromagnetic Compatibility) 
Engineering and Electrical Product Safety areas. I started making Tesla Coils in high school, and the coils gradually 
became larger, and larger, in an effort to make longer arcs.</p>
<p>About 9 years ago I became interested in the Steampunk community and its design aesthetic. In the Steampunk community 
Tesla has a near god status, so I built a Tesla Coil small enough to be easily moved, developed a presentation on the 
life and inventions of Nikola Tesla, and started giving talks at Steampunk and Science Fiction Conventions on Tesla 
with Tesla Coil demo sessions at the end.  All of my equipment is built with the Steampunk design aesthetic in mind 
and is designed to be displayed, and has been entered in several Steampunk Art shows. </p></p>
    <h2>Demonstrations</h2>
    <p><p>In my demonstrations I want to vividly show the beauty in the spectacular arcs, sparks and corona glow created by
Tesla Coils and other High Voltage apparatus. As part of the demos I add explanations of the science involved in
the operation of the equipment and the discharges. I put the high voltage devices into their place in the History
of Technology, and explain how advances in science allowed the development of devices that could generate ever higher 
voltages (and thus more beauty).</p>
<p>I typically start out my demos with the generation of high voltage Static electricity, and then progress to the 
development of Alternating Current (AC) electricity which allowed the use of transformers to produce high voltages 
(10,000 volts) such as used in the Jacobs Ladder apparatus with ascending arcs. A further development of the 
transformer produced the Induction Coil which can change 12V into 100,000 volts or more. The high voltage Direct 
Current (DC) produced by the Induction Coil (along with the use of vacuum pumps) led to the invention of Radio, 
X-ray tubes, and the discovery of the electron which was the first component of nuclear physics.
Plasma Globes and Plasma Light Sabers are an example of high voltage electrical discharges thru low pressure inert 
gases, and show the specific light spectrum emitted by each type of gas. This is how astronomers determine what types 
of atoms are in stars that are thousands of light years away.</p>
<p>In 1890 Nikola Tesla invented the Tesla Coil which took tens of thousands of volts generated by HV transformers 
and converted it to Radio Frequency energy which could be fed into his new coil, and then transformed into Millions 
of volts of electricity. His dream was to develop wireless power transmission for use by all of humanity, and this 
effort cumulated in his 1898 Tesla Coil in Colorado Springs that created 135 foot long arcs. For my demos I usually 
bring 2 medium Tesla coils, a vacuum tube Tesla Coil with 2 foot arcs and a traditional spark gap type Tesla Coil 
with 3 foot arcs.</p>
<p>A demo of my Tesla Coils and other high voltage equipment can last from about 20 minutes to over 50 minutes 
depending upon how many pieces of equipment I bring, how many experiments are run with each device, and how 
comprehensive my explanations of the science and operation of the apparatus are. I usually develop a semi-customized 
demo plan for each different venue. </p>
<p>I have run this equipment at over a dozen locations with no problems, including GearCon at the Lloyd Center 
Doubletree Hotel, the Red Lion at Jantzen beach, the Marriott Waterfront and the Crown Plaza hotels, at art 
galleries, and the Tillamook County Library. My equipment has been run at the OMSI (Oregon Museum of Science and Industry) 
Maker Fair for 5 years, and for three years there we ran my BIG Tesla Coil which has 6 to 7 foot long arcs. 
The Portland Fire Marshal inspected and approved my setups there every year. In February of 2018 I gave eight 
demos at the Portland Winter Light Festival. My setup was in the Oregon Rail Heritage Center, and we had between 
300 and 500 people at every demo. I estimate that over 5000 people have seen my demos with no problems.</p></p>
    <h2>Talks</h2>
    <p><p>I have developed a number of different lectures that I give on Science, on Tesla Coils, and on High Voltage equipment 
and effects. These are PowerPoint presentations and last from 30 to 50 minutes and can have Tesla Coil and high 
voltage demonstrations incorporated into them.</p>

    <h2>Technical Requirements</h2>
    <p><p>To demonstrate both of the medium Tesla Coils (3 foot arcs, 500 KV and 2 foot arcs, 300 KV)  I need a large 
(roughly 20 feet wide by 14 feet deep, with a 12 foot minimum ceiling height) <strong>DARK</strong> area so the faint luminous phenomena 
in the discharges can be seen. I usually bring 2 medium Tesla coils, a traditional spark gap type Tesla Coil with 3 
foot arcs, and a vacuum tube Tesla Coil with 2 foot arcs. I also have 3 large Jacobs Ladders with 2, 4, and 6 foot tall 
electrodes, Induction coils, Plasma Globes, and other 19th century High Voltage apparatus.</p>
<p>I need enough room to keep a minimum 6 foot radius clearance area around the 500 KV Tesla Coil (3 foot arc), and a 4 
foot radius clearance area around the 300 KV Tesla Coil (2 foot arc) so that the discharge will not touch anything. 
This discharge is around 500,000 volts, but the current is very low and the frequency is very high, so this discharge 
is not hazardous. In the early 1900’s they used Tesla Coils in Vaudeville shows where a person would be charged up, 
and could give 6 inch long sparks to an assistant.</p>
<p>There are hazardous voltages inside the Tesla Coil (120 volts and much higher voltages) so it is run in a roped off 
area, and it is controlled by a push button switch so it is only turned on when I want it on and I am viewing the area. 
I have lighted stanchions to create a roped off area all around the demonstration area to keep people out of the danger 
area. The equipment needs to be in <strong>DARK</strong> area so the faint luminous phenomena in the discharges can be seen.
Tesla Coils generate strong electric and magnetic fields, and RF fields in the 100 KHz to 500 KHz frequency range, 
which in rare cases may cause interference with nearby electronic and electrical equipment or PA systems.  People with 
implanted medical electronics should not be close to this equipment, so we post warning signs about this, and announce 
this to the audience before the demo. This has not been a problem in any of my demos. </p>
<p>I need to inspect the venue beforehand to be sure that my equipment will work well there.</p>
<p>The medium Tesla coil runs best on a 20-amp branch circuit at 120 VAC, and the other equipment will run on a 15-amp, 
120 VAC circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Setup time is 2 to 4 hours</strong> depending upon how much equipment I bring, and on how much help I have to assemble it. Much 
of my equipment is disassembled for storage, and for transport, so it must be reassembled for operation. For a full 
setup I bring about two SUV loads of equipment. Teardown is about half of the setup time. I like to have an assistant 
to help in the setup and teardown, and to help with demos so they run faster</p></p>
