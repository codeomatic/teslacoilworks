I have developed a number of different lectures that I give on Science, on Tesla Coils, and on High Voltage equipment 
and effects. These are PowerPoint presentations and last from 30 to 50 minutes and can have Tesla Coil and high 
voltage demonstrations incorporated into them.

    1. Nikola Tesla and his Era of Inventions.
    2. High Voltage Static Electricity
    3. The History of Exceptionally High Voltages – covers static and continuous electricity
    4. Technology of the Tesla Coil – how they are built and operate
    5. Vacuum Tubes and the Vacuum Tube Tesla Coil
    6. The Carrington Event – Effects of massive solar flares on our electrical grids.

Talks under development:

    1. Discovery of Cathode Rays – How electrons were discovered, with demos. 
    2. Lightning: Ball Lightning, Red Sprites, and Giant Blue Spires
