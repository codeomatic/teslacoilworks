    <title>Tesla Coil Works - Technical Requirements</title>

    <h1>Technical Requirements</h1>
    

    <p>To demonstrate both of the medium Tesla Coils (3 foot arcs, 500 KV and 2 foot arcs, 300 KV)  I need a large 
(roughly 20 feet wide by 14 feet deep, with a 12 foot minimum ceiling height) <strong>DARK</strong> area so the faint luminous phenomena 
in the discharges can be seen. I usually bring 2 medium Tesla coils, a traditional spark gap type Tesla Coil with 3 
foot arcs, and a vacuum tube Tesla Coil with 2 foot arcs. I also have 3 large Jacobs Ladders with 2, 4, and 6 foot tall 
electrodes, Induction coils, Plasma Globes, and other 19th century High Voltage apparatus.</p>
<p>I need enough room to keep a minimum 6 foot radius clearance area around the 500 KV Tesla Coil (3 foot arc), and a 4 
foot radius clearance area around the 300 KV Tesla Coil (2 foot arc) so that the discharge will not touch anything. 
This discharge is around 500,000 volts, but the current is very low and the frequency is very high, so this discharge 
is not hazardous. In the early 1900â€™s they used Tesla Coils in Vaudeville shows where a person would be charged up, 
and could give 6 inch long sparks to an assistant.</p>
<p>There are hazardous voltages inside the Tesla Coil (120 volts and much higher voltages) so it is run in a roped off 
area, and it is controlled by a push button switch so it is only turned on when I want it on and I am viewing the area. 
I have lighted stanchions to create a roped off area all around the demonstration area to keep people out of the danger 
area. The equipment needs to be in <strong>DARK</strong> area so the faint luminous phenomena in the discharges can be seen.
Tesla Coils generate strong electric and magnetic fields, and RF fields in the 100 KHz to 500 KHz frequency range, 
which in rare cases may cause interference with nearby electronic and electrical equipment or PA systems.  People with 
implanted medical electronics should not be close to this equipment, so we post warning signs about this, and announce 
this to the audience before the demo. This has not been a problem in any of my demos. </p>
<p>I need to inspect the venue beforehand to be sure that my equipment will work well there.</p>
<p>The medium Tesla coil runs best on a 20-amp branch circuit at 120 VAC, and the other equipment will run on a 15-amp, 
120 VAC circuit.</p>
<p><strong>Setup time is 2 to 4 hours</strong> depending upon how much equipment I bring, and on how much help I have to assemble it. Much 
of my equipment is disassembled for storage, and for transport, so it must be reassembled for operation. For a full 
setup I bring about two SUV loads of equipment. Teardown is about half of the setup time. I like to have an assistant 
to help in the setup and teardown, and to help with demos so they run faster</p>
